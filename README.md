## Overview

This repository contains tutorial code for developing and deploying a dash application - a data app platform using Python. The goal is to provide an example of a well structured application, utilizing a wide variety of dash features, and being easily generalizable to other use cases.

## Data

The data used for this project is the Heart Failure prediction dataset available on kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data

## Final Product

The finished dashboard can be seen below, it includes a wide variety of dash components and can be easily modified for other datasets that require multiple graphs, text box's, and filters.
